Description: This package implements five methods proposed by
    Resnik, Schlicker, Jiang, Lin and Wang respectively
    for measuring semantic similarities among DO terms and
    gene products. Enrichment analyses including hypergeometric
    model and gene set enrichment analysis are also implemented
    for discovering disease associations of high-throughput
    biological data.
